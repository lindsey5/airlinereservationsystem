                    <h2>4. Fares and Fees</h2>
                    <h3>Fare Class and Baggage Allowance</h3>
                    <p>
                    We offer a range of fare types, including bronze, silver, and gold tier. Each fare type has its own baggage allowance. Services like priority check-in and boarding, seat selection, excess baggage, and in-flight meals and beverages are determined by the type of flight fare selected.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Additional Fees</h3>
                    <p>Additional charges may apply for taxes and other fees.</p>
                    <h3>Currency Conversion</h3>
                    <p>
                    Fares may be displayed in multiple currencies. However, all payments will be processed in the local currency of the country where the booking is made.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Delays and Cancellations</h3>
                    <p>
                    In Philippine airlines, it's common for them to state that they are not responsible for delays or cancellations caused by factors outside their control, such as weather conditions or air traffic control issues. However, for situations within their control, such as operational delays or cancellations, they typically offer compensation or rebooking options, in line with local regulations. For example, in the Philippines, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) provides guidelines for passenger rights in cases of flight disruptions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Lost or Damaged Baggage</h3>
                    <p>
                    Airlines typically limit their liability for lost or damaged baggage based on international conventions, such as the Montreal Convention or Warsaw Convention. This often means compensation is capped at a specific amount (e.g., approximately $1,700 for international flights under the Montreal Convention).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Passenger Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>
                    Passengers are usually required to notify the airline within a specific timeframe to claim compensation for lost or damaged baggage.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Compensation Policies</h3>
                    <p>
                    Terms often specify how compensation for delays, cancellations, or denied boarding will be providedâ€”such as meal vouchers, accommodations, refunds, or flight credits.
